For this fork, I am addressing three issues:
# Reduce script numbering clashes between remote teams.  To do this, I am:
## Creating a ChangeScriptCreator class that timestamps change scripts (instead of using sequential numbering) and can be run from the command line, Ant, or Maven.
## Changing the change script numbering to use a long instead of an int to support the timestamp numbering
# Fix issues our team is running into with running PL/SQL using the DirectToDbApplier (ref: "dbdeploy issue 43":http://code.google.com/p/dbdeploy/issues/detail?id=43).
# Create a Maven plugin to apply change scripts and create new change scripts
